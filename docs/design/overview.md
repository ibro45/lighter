## The Challenges of Deep Learning Experimentation

Deep learning has revolutionized many fields, but the process of conducting deep learning research and development can be complex and time-consuming. Researchers and practitioners often face challenges such as:

*   **Boilerplate Code**: Writing repetitive code for training loops, data loading, metric calculation, and experiment setup for each new experiment.
*   **Configuration Management**: Managing a large number of hyperparameters, settings, and experimental configurations across different projects and experiments.
*   **Reproducibility**: Ensuring that experiments are reproducible and that results can be reliably replicated.
*   **Scalability**: Scaling experiments to larger datasets, models, and distributed computing environments.
*   **Collaboration**: Sharing and collaborating on experiments with other researchers or team members.

These challenges can hinder productivity, slow down experimentation, and make it harder to focus on the core aspects of deep learning research: model architecture, data, and algorithms.

## Introducing Lighter: Configuration-Driven Deep Learning

**Lighter** is a Python library designed to address these challenges and streamline deep learning experimentation. It uses YAML configuration files for experiment definition and management.

**Core Philosophy**:

Lighter's core philosophy is to **separate configuration from code** and provide a **high-level, declarative way to define deep learning experiments**. Use Lighter to:

*   **Focus on the Essentials**: Concentrate on core research components (models, datasets, losses, metrics) reducing boilerplate.
*   **Simplify Experiment Setup**: Define experiments in config files.
*   **Enhance Reproducibility**: Config files capture all settings in a version-controlled format.
*   **Improve Collaboration**: Share experiments easily via `config.yaml` files.
*   **Increase Productivity**: Reduce code maintenance, freeing time for research and development.

**Key Features**:

*   **Configuration-Driven Workflow**: Define experiments in `config.yaml`.
*   **Seamless PyTorch Lightning Integration**: Leverages PyTorch Lightning's training engine and features.
*   **MONAI Ecosystem Compatibility**: Integrates with MONAI for medical imaging tasks.
*   **Dynamic Module Loading**: Dynamically load custom components via configuration.
*   **Extensible Architecture**: Customize with adapters, callbacks, and custom components.
*   **Simplified Training, Validation, Testing, and Prediction**: Simple CLI commands for training, validation, testing, and prediction.
*   **Experiment Management**: Organize experiments with configuration files and experiment tracking tools.

## Design Principles of Lighter

Lighter is built upon the following key design principles:

1.  **Convention over Configuration**:

    *   Provides sensible defaults for common tasks, reducing configuration needs.
    *   Offers customization when defaults are insufficient.

2.  **Modularity and Reusability**:

    *   Encourages modular design with reusable and composable components (models, datasets, metrics, callbacks).

3.  **Extensibility and Customization**:

    *   Extensible and customizable for diverse research needs. Easily add:
        *   Custom Models
        *   Custom Datasets
        *   Custom Metrics
        *   Custom Callbacks
        *   Custom Inferers
        *   Adapters

4.  **Seamless PyTorch Lightning Integration**:

    *   Tightly integrated with PyTorch Lightning, leveraging its core features.
    *   Easy to learn for PyTorch Lightning users.
