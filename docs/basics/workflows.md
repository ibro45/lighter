# Running Workflows

Once the configuration is establised, Lighter can run different deep learning workflows. The following workflows are supported:

1. fit
2. validate
3. test
4. predict
5. tune

These workflows are inherited from the Pytorch lightning trainer and can be found in the [PL docs](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/common/trainer.html#methods)

We also show below how you can run these workflows and what are some "required" definitions in the config while running these workflows. 

## Fit workflow


## Validate workflow

## Test workflow

## Predict workflow


## Tune workflow
